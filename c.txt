After moving to MÃ¡laga, I immersed myself in continuous learning, attending talks and conferences on science and art, and actively participating in the university.<br>
                    At university, I have not only been part of RoboRescue UMA, a rescue robotics team, but also led and won challenges such as the CyberPhysics Challenge (a Digital Twin for Fujitsu) and the Flash Session Hackathon (a business development contest). <br>
                    My leadership even took me to Berkeley, where I attended an entrepreneurship course after winning Flash Session Hackathon.<br>
                    Upon my return, I founded Untaught, a student association dedicated to spreading knowledge about Malaga companies and research groups. Currently, I chair this association while working in a company that designs haptic suits <br>
                    and developing my own space robotics projects. I am currently working on several of them: from the creation of telescopes with automatic navigation to modular mini-rovers for planetary exploration, and even nanometer positioning systems for telescopes, <br>
                    always with an innovative approach and tireless dedication <br>
                    In addition to my technical skills, I have cultured leadership skills by leading projects and serving on the Electronics Department Council for two years. My determination and passion for science drive me to share my knowledge through engineering <br>
                    outreach talks and local radio collaborations to spread the word about space robotics. <br>
                    I am looking forward to improving my experience and skills in any enterprise or research team in the field of space robotics. The opportunity to contribute and continue to innovate in this exciting field is an absolute honour.
